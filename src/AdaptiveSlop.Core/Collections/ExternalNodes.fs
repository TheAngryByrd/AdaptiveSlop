// =============================================================================
// External sources (MAPA-DESIGN §1.1): ofExternal — snapshot function +
// invalidate handle.
//
// Semantics: the user provides a snapshot function and receives an invalidate
// handle. The snapshot is re-read at most once per invalidate, on the next
// read, and diffed against the previous snapshot; the diff is delivered
// through the normal delta machinery. Not invalidated → zero cost: no re-read,
// no diff, no allocation.
//
// The invalidate handle is O(1) at call time and deferred (invariant 3: no
// evaluation during the write). Thread-safe via the post ring (the cval.Post
// pattern): an owner-thread call bumps the write generation directly; a
// foreign-thread call enqueues, and the bump happens at the next graph
// operation on the owner thread.
//
// The user never marks: the handle is the user-facing form of the same
// write-notification path the *A nodes use internally (it bumps the write
// generation, so the *A gates re-scan and the dirty caches invalidate).
