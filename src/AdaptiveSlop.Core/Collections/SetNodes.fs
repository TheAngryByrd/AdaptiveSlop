// AdaptiveSet transform nodes (PLAN.md Section 6.9)

// A derived node registers with its dependencies on first read. A dependency
// push appends to the journal and advances the version and the write
// generation. Reads cascade over changed dependencies, drain the journal,
// and return a transient view of the internal state. `force` materializes a
// FrozenSet. Disposal unregisters and stops all delta processing.

// =============================================================================
// Scalar escape hatches: per-element contains and incremental count.
//
// Lazy scalar nodes (see the map escapes in MapNodes.fs): they register
// nothing, writes only bump the source version (O(1)), and the node
// re-syncs at its next read — the per-element precision that the plain
// AdaptiveNode-over-GetValue pattern cannot express (the whole-set version
// and the flat dependency carry no element information).
//
// Pull-only protocol: no parent edges, no write-time marking, no delivery.
// The version bump in the read-time re-sync is the only notification;
// consumers version-check the node and recompute only when the watched
// output moved. For a direct changeable source the re-sync is O(1). For a
// pull-lazy derived source the output delta exists only after
// its drain, so the source's version moves at write time and the dirty
// indicator (version + 1) makes the consumer re-read exactly once; the gate
// then runs at the next read (the documented depth-2 rule).
